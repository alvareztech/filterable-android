# Filterable for Android

This is a filter application that uploads a photo from the gallery of your phone and is able to switch between filters (we have 24) with the left and right swipe gesture, in addition you will have some options to configure the compression and intensity of the filter. This application cannot be complete if it does not have a save option, so it will have this option and it will be used to make comparisons to see if the compression option works. We will do this with Image Vision SDK.
